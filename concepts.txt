type - WHAT TYPE OF LIMITS ARE IMPOSED these are of three types 
hard - this limit cannot be overridden by any user 
soft - User can increase its limits  
dash - This specifies this is both hard limit and soft limit 

item - ON WHAT ITEM LINITS ARE IMPOSED 
There are variety of items for example nproc aka maximum number of processes a user can run in current session nproc maxlogins
fsize aka maximum filesize created per session the value is in kilobytes 
cpu aka muximum time cpu can be used the value is in minutes 

value - HOW MUCH RESOURCE IS PROVIDED
